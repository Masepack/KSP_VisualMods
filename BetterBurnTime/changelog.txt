Version 1.6  (CURRENT VERSION)
* Add "atmosphere tracker" that shows a message when you're imminently about to enter or leave atmosphere.


Version 1.5.4  (2017-05-28)
* Update default countdown dots for KSP 1.3 compatibility (1.3 broke the fonts)

Version 1.5.3  (2016-12-14)

Version 1.5.2  (2016-12-12)
* BROKEN VERSION, DO NOT USE.  Navball is hopelessly mangled whenever impact tracker or closest-approach tracker is active.
* Fix a bug that spams an error message "Parent of RectTransform is being set with parent property." when the mod starts up. (Thanks to DMagic for catching!)
* Fix NRE that happens sometimes when switching to a vessel that already has a maneuver node set.


Version 1.5.1  (2016-10-18)
* Fixed a bug that caused BBT to spam NullReferenceException when impact-tracking a vessel that has a kerbal in a command chair.
* Added BetterBurnTimeData as a public API for the mod.
* Added sample code in new "example" github directory, illustrating how to use it.


Version 1.5  (2016-10-11)
* Update for compatibility with KSP 1.2.
