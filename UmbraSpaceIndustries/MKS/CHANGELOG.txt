Fixed the Habitation capability of the Karibou Crew Cab (Thanks voicey99!)
Orbital Logistics are back!
- Both Tundra and Duna Logistics Modules can now initiate transfers.  
- Both sending and receiving vessels require a logistics module to be present.
Drills have received a balance pass.  Mass will tend to drop a bit, efficiency will slightly increase for manned drills, decrease for unmanned drills.  These tweaks are reflected on the USI Balance Worksheet.
An issue causing extreme lag when working with parts that have swappable converters has been corrected, and the configs of all parts with swappable converters have been updated.



0.53.0 - 2017.10.09
------------------
KSP 1.3.1
Fixed recycleable amount for fertilizer(G) (Thanks jarosm!)
Fixed PAL_Gripper syntax errors (thanks Wyzard256!)
Reduced KIS volume of the Node Helper (Thanks Wyzard256!)
Moved automated drills into appropriate CTT categories (Thanks Wyzard256!)

0.52.3 - 2017.09.08
------------------
Dependency Updates

0.52.2 - 2017.08.15
---------------
Dependency Updates (including updating Ground Construction)
Mechanics can now swap converters (not just engineers)
Better Weight Distribution mechanics (thanks Dboi88!)
Restore class name as default display title in the VAB for converters
Fixed some potential nullref spam
Fixed an issue where Karibou legs started as deployed

0.52.1 - KSP 1.3
-------------------
KSP 1.3 Compatibility
Fix local logistics vessel list not being updated
Sifters now use the geology bonus
Allow incremental payment of inflatables deployment cost
Fix recruitement of various kolonist classes
Updated TAC-LS config
Added rock production to various drills, as well as residual rock output to different converters (Thanks voicey99!)
Removed hard coded references to the EXConstructionSkill (these are handled via MM) - thanks theRagingIrishman!
The Pioneer Modules and Logistics Centers are now probe control points (thanks DanStaal!)
Fix for AC Recruitment and planet packs (Thanks Gnurfos!)!
Fore and aft attachment nodes for the Karibou hub roof rack (Thanks Wyzard256!)
Removed OSE's extra harvesters from stock drills when MKS is installed (Thanks Qyzard256!)
Stock Fuel cells now produce water as a byproduct (Thanks Boiler1!)
Custom settings via the stock settings dialog have been added:
* You may now disable machinery consumption for MKS.  The default is on.  This setting effectively puts this mod very close to where MKS-Lite was, and is a good starting point if you want to avoid most of the core resource chain.
Extensive changes to the Astronaut Complex.  You can now:
* Toggle the ability to customize Kerbonauts.  If enabled, you can change bravery/stupidity and choose a starting level.  If disabled, these options will not be available.
* Enable / disable the hiring of Kolonist Kerbonauts (i.e. combined with the option below, you can disable MKS extended classes altogether).
* Enable / disable Kolonist Kerbonauts being available in rescue contracts (if disabled, only base kerbonauts appear as rescue kerbals).  
* Use either the stock calculated cost or a custom price for your Kerbals.  This setting is independent for base vs kolonists, so you could use standard pricing for your pilots, engineers, and scientists - but still get cheap pricing for Kolonists.
* Enable/disable and configure a custom price cap for all hires.  i.e. you could decide to use the stock hiring scheme, but with a specific max cap so it does not rise to unreasonable exponential numbers.

0.50.18 - 2017.03.17
--------------------
Updated drill descriptions (Thanks voicey99!)
MPU's now have a 10x processing boost for fuel products only to make them more in line with stock ISRU modules (Thanks voicey99!)
Fixed NRE with the Kolonization Monitor in the KSC scene (Thanks Gnurfos!)
Fixed typos in the new processor start/stop actions (thanks jarosm!)
Fixed output resource for fertilizer converters (thanks drgola!)
No longer suppress EL parts (thanks Dstaal!)
Fixed a ton of miscellaneous non-breaking config/load errors (thanks theRagingIrishman!)
Added ModuleLogisticsConsumer to the fuel cell array (Thanks Fury1SOG!)
Deprecated outdated MFT configurations
Removed all references to ReplacementParts as those are not being currently used
Scavenging/Logistics will only push/pull to remote parts or consider remote parts that are USI warehouses.  Parts local to the vessel are unaffected.
Updated costs of the MPUs
Adjusted MPU consumption rate/machinery requirements as this was having an effect on production rate
Updated impact range of drills
Corrected texture for the Tundra workshop (thanks FirroSeranel!)
Fixed an issue where multi-bay efficiency parts were providing a significantly larger bonus than they should have.  The multipliers for all modules have been divided by the number of bays (boo!)
When using OSE Workshop, all recipes now require a quantity of specialized parts

0.50.17 - 2017.02.24
-------------------
New Features and Updates:
- Mechanics can now perform EVA maintenance
- Mechanics and Technicians can now work in Ground Construction workshops
- Machinery can be transferred again via Planetary Logistics	
- MKS now uses Ground Construction Core.  This means the only default GC part you will see is the (new) DIYKit.  GC Workshop functionality has been included in the Ranger Workshop, Tundra Assembly Plant, and a new Tundra-250 style Workshop.
- Buffed the Ranger OSE Workshop, added OSE capabilities to the Tundra 250
- Planetary logistics now defaults to OFF.  Local logistics still defaults to ON.
- Replaced the Astronaut Complex code with an implementation of TheReadPanda's Hiring mod (Thanks for letting me use this!)
- There are three new drills, one counterpart for each of the three existing MKS drills (with the added benefit of Ore drilling), optimized for remote operation.  They have been rebalanced to have the same mass, but will not have Kolony bonuses or specialty bonuses/penalties.
- All MKS parts that utilize core heat (PDU's, Drills) have had their max coolant capacity increased tenfold to account for issues with efficiency causing excessive overheating.
- There are three new automated refineries suitable for unattended operations.  These come in 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 form factors, and may also be used as efficiency parts for the larger MKS refinery.  Note that these only handle refining for Tier-1 materials (Ore->LF,Ox,MP, Metals, Chemicals, Polymers, and Fertilizer via Gypsum or Minerals).  One thing to note is that these modules feature redundant systems in the form of extra machinery and reduced machinery draw, resulting in significantly longer run-times without maintenance. 
- The two docks created originally for EL are now marked Legacy.
- Agriculture modules now use the Botany bonus to their converters.
- Habitats, MedBays, and Kolonization Modules now use the Kolonization bonus to their converters.
- The Geology kolony reward has been renamed to Industry (since it encompasses everything from resource harvesting through refining and manufacturing) to avoid confusion.
- The three new automated refineries are Planetary Logistics capable for push operations only (i.e. even with a pilot present, they will not pull).  
- Kolonization Modules now have the option to enable Kolony Growth.  When enabled, new Kerabls will spawn provided that the Kolonization Module is active, it has space for the new crew, and you have at least one male and one female in your colony
- Alphabetize Planetary Logistics, and fixed a nullref in maintenance (thanks Gnurfos!)
- The larger resource lodes (the ones picked up by the orbital scanner) are now eight times larger!

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where resources were being double-consumed when converters were swapped
- Fixed a small hab issue with the Karibou cab
- Fixed an issue where efficiency parts were not respecting the efficiency part tag, also some other refactoring (Thanks Gnurfos!)
- Asteroids no longer return material kits when scrapped.

0.50.16 - 2017.02.05
------------------

For users of EL, Technicians and Mechanics now have the ExConstructionSkill.
You can no longer scrap EVA Kerbals...  (Thanks jd284!)
New nodes on the Tundra modules and KSPedia entries (Thanks dboi88!)
Added an antenna to the Salamander (Thanks voicey99!)
Updated the Karibou to use CCK (Thanks DStaal)
You can now toggle local logistics and planetary logistics separately on warehouses
A new line of Tundra ISM's have been introduced.  These use the 4.75m form factor and are equivalent to the Ranger ISMs.
Fixed a bug where some expandable parts were not properly receiving shielding from fairings.
Fixed cost bugs with the Tundra PDU and P-Log Modules
Material Kits can now come from the local vessel even if the container is not a warehouse.
The Ranger mini hab now has its own texture.
Agriculture converters no longer require Organics as an input

0.50.14 - 2017.01.16

Fixed texture path for Toolbar icons (Thanks fat-lobyte!)
Fixed issue where the KoloniationMonitor was displaying incorrect resources (thanks again fat-lobyte!)
Efficiency Parts are no longer bound to skill bonuses

0.50.11 - 2017.01.08
--------------------
Fixed an issue where multi-bay modules were not operating at peak efficiency (Note that this is a USI Tools change so be sure to have the latest version!  This is why I bundle MiniAVC ;))
Reduced the size of Resource Lodes to 5kl
Added a new resource lode that can be found via the orbital survey scanner.  Unlike the smaller ones found with the Pioneer module, these are planet-wide and significantly larger (500kl).
Scouts can now be recruited.
The USI-LS window no longer conflicts with the Kolonization Dashboard.
Fixed prices of Tundra manufacturing modules.

0.50.10 - 2017.01.07
--------------------
Added the ExplorerSkill effect and Scout trait.  Explorers (which include Scouts and Pilots) are immune from habitation effects in USI-LS.
Any Kerbal on a planet that has a Kolonization level of 500% and is in a vessel with a habitation rating of 1 year or more will be immune to habitation effects, as this world is now 'Kolonized'.
Habitation Extenders will take into account habitation multipliers, making ark ships easier.
Fixed an issue where ResourceLodes could be added to craft :)
No more flag scrapping! (Thanks MadMerlyn!)
Several profile/CLS fixes for tundra modules from Kerbas-ad-astra
Added an attach node to the mini drill (Thanks MadMerlyn!)


0.50.9 - 2017.01.01
-------------------
Add Silicates, Silicon, RefinedExotics, ColonySupplies, and Organics to Karabou storage modules. (thanks boiler1!)
Updated OSE Workshop support (thanks dboi88!)
Local Logistics:  Resources may now be manually transferred between any two craft within 150m provided crew are present on at least one of the two vessels.  This GUI may be accessed from the Kolonization Dashboard.
Active Resource Harvesting:  Pioneer Modules may now perform a Resource Scan which will identify nearby 'Resource Lodes'.  These are physical objects that must be grappled, at which point both the Range and Tundra regolith sifters can convert the ResourceLode resource into a variety of other resources based on planetary composition (similar to how Dirt works today).    
Due to a fire at the USI Warehouse, Prices for the Duna, Tundra, and Ranger modules have dropped.  Note that all warranties are now void.
Refinery output efficiency has been buffed by 500%.  Applies to all refineries, sifters, crushers, and smelters.
The stock surface scanner now shows data for all relevant resources - enjoy prospecting!
All USI reactors and the Ranger Power Pack now include a fill-cap of 95% to leave some headroom for solar panels.
Planetary Logistics no longer require a pilot to push resources, only to pull (welcome back unmanned mining bases, we missed you!)
Demolition for the massses!  Demo charges and part scrapping no longer have a trait requirement.
Habitation EC costs have been reduced accross the board.
Fixed a missing attachment node on the Duna modules
Added the Akita Rover from Konstruction
The Tundra Multihub now features 10,000l of KIS storage
The Scout Lander Mk2 now has 1,000l of KIS storage (enough to stuff a single MKS Ranger module)
The Tundra airlock (the larger one) also gets 1,000l of KIS storage.  
The Tundra 250 hubs (both versions) get 3,000l of KIS storage.
All MKS drills now have a heat overlay
The Ranger AgModule now shows up only in Kolonization, not life suppurt.
You can no longer utilize modules before they are expanded (booo!)

0.50.8 - (KSP 1.2.2)
-------------------
Updates for KSP 1.2.2
The Karibou Rover has been merged into MKS.
Added Weight Distribution to the Ranger Battery Pack and Mini Hab (Thanks Dboi88)
Since MKS does change the behavior of EL reactions, in the short term, we're moving back to part supression.  
Several new Kerbal types have been added!  They can be recruited directly from the Kolonization Dashboard at a significant discount (as well as recruiting Pilots, Engineers, and Scientists.)
All converters have had their effects updated.  Note that Scientists, Engineers, and Pilots will encompass relevant (new) effects, so this change is backwards compatible.  But you now have the option of using low-cost Kolonists for crewing your colonies.
Bundled MKS KSPedia!  Thanks Dboi88!
The heat pump will no longer deactivate, but instead will simply cease working if your ship does a physics 'hop' on load.
Ranger workshop moved earlier in the CTT tech tree

0.50.7 - 2016.11.23
-------------------
Fixed converter nullref spam

0.50.6 - 2016.11.19
-------------------
Various fixes to the efficiency system

0.50.5 - (KSP 1.2.1)
--------------------
Fixed an issue where disabling one warehouse disabled all planetary logistics
Updated the efficiency part and swappable bay logic to fix several efficiency issues
Updated all converters and harvesters to properly reflect dynamic load
Increased cost of the Salamander (Thanks LeLeon!)
Corrected fertilizer consumption on the Duna Agroponics Module (Thanks andreszlima!)
Moved stabilizers, etc. to the 'Ground' category (Thanks SixDasher!)
Fixed node points for the short Tundra Hub (Thanks Tarheel1999!)
Various CTT / Category fixes (Thanks SirCharizard17!)
Fixed mass of the 4x Kontainer Tank (Thanks kkdredd!)
Added some new code to support experience effects for resource converters.  Note that as this is based on stock, your Kerbal must be in the same vessel to ge the specialty bonus.  But they do not need to be inside of the part.
Moved Ranger battery pack to specializedElectrics
Drill separators now properly separate and stack
Pilots can be anywhere within 500m of a base to provide logistics
Planetary Logistics now properly requires a pilot
Recyclers and Habs will work even with reduced efficiency, and properly scale down effecacy.
Fixed the cost / balance of the various airlocks
Moved Skycrane to the Engine category
Corrected descriptions for the Tundra agriculture modules
Added EC to a number of modules that were missing it
The Space Akademy training function is open for business again!
Fixed the workshop CTT node
Fixed various USI-LS issues (see that changelog) that impacted life support modules
The assembly plant now includes the auto repair function
Updated the mass of several parts
Updated costs for various modules
The nuclear fuel processor no longer has storage for Enridhed Uranium and Depleted Fuel.  But its converters can now properly feed containers for these resources on the same vessel.  So attach Nuclear and depleted fuel containers, whicn are configured as warehouses then perform maintenance to use the fuel.


0.50.4 - 2016.10.22
-------------------
Fixed an issue involving the dynamic mass of expanded modules
Fixed EPL config (Thanks Aelfhe1m and everyone for helping!)
Part Tags!  (Thanks DavidRWilliamsJr!)
Fixed FlexOTube texture (Thanks	mattpolicastro!)
Added a new short version of the 250 Hub with 2.5m end caps vs. 1.25m end caps.
Added swap costs to the part info for swappable parts.
Pioneer Modules now let you collect your Colony Rewards via the PAW
For all ranger modules over 2 tons, moved a portion of their mass into MaterialKits.
Added a new module - a Geothermal Heat Pump.  This module lets you use geothermal wells to provide cooling for your various modules.  Works as an active vessel wide radiator with the added benefit of being able to bleed off significant thermal flux.

0.50.3 - 2016.10.16
-------------------
Fixed a lot of logistics-related log spam and possibly other shenanigans
Fixed the EL config
Beefed up Tundra nodes

0.50.2 - 2016.10.16
-------------------
Added a Ranger-style 6K battery 
Added Mulch to the supply pack
CTT Update!  (Thanks theRagingIrisman!)
Fixed missing ResourceDistributor configs for the Pioneer and Logistics Centers

0.50.1 - 2016.10.15
-------------------
Corrected an issue where some modules were not auto-transferring resources
Corrected an issue where modules were deactivating on scene change
Corrected an issue where efficiency converters were not working properly
Fixed several icon transparency issues
The Salamander and Scout Lander are now in correct default tech tree nodes
Fixed resource typo for minerals
The Ranger Crusher and Smelter now have better colliders
Modules that can take advantage of an Efficiency Part have their efficiency group listed in the VAB (i.e. Greenhouse, Crusher, Smelter).  these correspond to the efficiency converter on other parts (by convention shown in brackets - i.e. [Greenhouse])
Station Manager and Orbital Logistics icons are gone for now while I work on their replacements.
Fixed an issue that was causing a stack overflow crash when the HabRing was selected and USI-LS was not present.
Added Salamander and Scout-II CTT Updates
Globally reduced EC costs for swapping modules in flight

0.50.0 - (KSP 1.2)
------------------
Dependency Updates, and recompilation for KSP 1.2
UKS, Kolonization, Konstruction, and MKS-Lite have all been merged into a single package, and we will be using the original mod name (Modular Kolonization System - MKS).
Revised / consolidated part lines!
- Ranger Series.  Light, expandable, KAS/KIS deployable.  Great for your first bases.
- Duna series.  Ruggedized, more advanced modules.  Also compatible with the Karibou for mobile bases.
- Tundra-250 Series.  Similar to the Duna parts, though a bit larger and more delicate.  Excellent for stations or anything built on a 2.5m stack.
- Tundra-375 Series.  Replacements for the old Mk-III modules.  Larger versions of the Tundra-250's, but more focused on manufacturing and other advanced colony functions.
Many parts, even if they are the same or very similar, have been renamed.  Be sure to get rid of the following folders (if you are installing over an older version):
- UmbraSpaceIndistries/Kolonization
- UmbraSpaceIndistries/MKS-Lite
- UmbraSpaceIndistries/UKS
ModuleCommand has been removed from most of the modules (other than those meant to be command pods) This will help with PAW spam and performance.  So be sure your base has at least one part that includes ModuleCommand!
Resources are now transferred to planetary storage when flowState is toggled to false. This allows for dumping resources into planetary storage and also to keep from pulling a unwanted resource from planetary storage.  (Thanks qberticus!)
Less hobbit-like Kerbals.  The default supply consumption has been adjusted slightly downward (from 16.2 per day to 10.8 per day) - no more second breakfasts.  To adjust for this, change per second consumption to 0.0005 from 0.00075 in the GUI.
With the general rebalance, there are siginificant EC requirement changes.  Be sure to account for this!
Added the Planetary Assembly Lander, a series of parts for base construction,  Including:
- Truss segments and Stabilizers
- Wheels
- Magnetic grapplers
- Forklifts and Claws
- Cradles for mounting 2.5/3.75m horizontal modules
Modified the stock Klaw to also include an electromagnet.
Included new Construction Port variants (stack-attach only) based on the Clamp-o-Tron docking port.  These can be compressed and the parent parts fused together.  They can also have their force/torque/roll/range settings adjusted dynamically, and snap in 90 degree increments when docking.
All Konstruction parts appear in their own custom category.
Added the Akita Rover - a small rover that can be mixed and matched with parts from the Planetary Assembly Lander.  Akita parts can be found in the Construction category.
Added the Salamander command pod and the Scout Lander Mk-II.  These replace the Scout Lander and Koala command pod, which has been deprecated.
Engineers can now operate power couplers if they are within scavange range (thanks tomforwood).
Two way auto transfers!  Resources above 85% are now pushed to warehouses (thanks tomforwood).
Resources are now transferred to planetary storage when flowState is toggled to false. This allows for dumping resources into planetary storage and also to keep from pulling a unwanted resource from planetary storage.  (Thanks qberticus!)
All Kontainers moved to the Logistics division (to support new category icons)
All tanks now have a standard crash tolerance of 8m/s and are set to stock dry mass / volume ratios.
Corrected volume of the containers (no more kontainers of holding)
Dry Kontainers and Tanks now have five more resources - Silicates, Silicon, RefinedExotics, Organics, and ColonySupplies.
Organics has made a comeback!  These represent more complex crops as well as edible organisms such as fish, etc.  They require an initial stock, take up a lot more space, are slower to convert and are more resource intensive, but are a key component of ColonySupplies.
ColonySupplies - represents better food, disco-filled thumb drives, and other quality of life improvements for your Kerbals that can affect their hab timer.
The drill models have been reduced to three - Small, Medum, and Large.  Resource selection (Dirt or discreet resources) is now handled via swappable sorters.  One sorter in the small drill, three in the medium, and five in the large.
Swapping drill sorters requires an expenditure of MaterialKits, SpecializedParts, and ElectricCharge, and is done on EVA with an engineer.  These are drawn from eligible resource warehouses.
All procesing and conversion modules also take advantage of swappable bays, with some models having more than one processing bay that can be configured.
Efficiency parts now require resources to operate, generally ElectricCharge.  They may also (in some cases) use RequiredResources.
Efficiency has been drastically simplified, and uses only the stock attributes and a relative weight bonus from efficiency parts shared accross similar converters.
- Efficiency Parts now add a variable efficiency bonus to the converter versus a flat 100%
- Both Efficiency Parts and the modules that consume them are grouped by 'Tags'.  These are grouped together, and efficiency bonuses are weighted, so larger modules will consume more of the total efficiency bonus available.
- By convention, Efficiency Part converters are shown in brackets so you can quickly identify which efficiency converters support which modules.  For example, the [Greenhouse] converter on the expandable AgModule supports any larger converter that has a [Greenhouse] tag.
- Living Space / Happiness has been deprecated (this is a life support concern)
- Workspaces have been deprecated - this is assumed to be worked into the mass, etc. of the converter.
- Stock efficiency calculations for appropriate crew traits will be used.  This means you only need a single Kerbal present on the vessel with the appropriate trait.  So large industrial colonies relying mostly on automation will work fine.
Checking for Kolony Rewards is no longer automatic, and is a function of the Pioneer Module.  Rewards are still accumulated with any MKS module, but can only be collected once a Pioneer Module is present.
All MK-III and OKS Parts have been DEPRECATED!  These are replaced by the Tundra 250 and 375 series parts (see below)
Logistics Tweaks.
- Scavenging remains as is.
- Resource Distribution still requires a distributor.  Duna/Tundra Pioneer Modules and the Karibou retain this role.
- Warehouse leveling has been deprecated.
- Planetary Logistics requires a Logistics Center, available in Duna and Tundra form factors.  The Logistics Center will scan any directly attached warehouses for resources to send to the planetary pool.  The best use case for this is to use the new overflow mechanics to fill a nearby logistics vessel which in turn can ship off the excess.
MKS Part Updates - These are generic parts that are used by several modules.  
- The little trolley wheels are back, and fully functional.
- A new stabilizer featuring rotations that allow horizontal mounting, and a stock alike gray paintjob on the original stabilizer
- The skycrane got a paint job as well and is a bit less clown like
- Fixed an issue where the Microwave Tranceiver and Power Coupler were not tranceiving or coupling...
- Deprecated the deployable light globe while it awaits it's replacement
- The original rigid tube is now gone, and replaced by the 'Tundra' Multi-Truss.
- The planetary survey scanner has been deprecated, as it's functions can be replicated with stock parts.
- The MKS docking port has been deprecated, use stock parts instead.
- Expand-O-Tubes have been deprecated.  Use Tundra Multi-Trusses with konstruction and docking ports.
- The Flex-O-Tube has been moved to the new Coupling parts category
- The Logistics Hub part is no longer included pending it's replacement.
- Mobile and Module Bases have been deprecated.
- The MKS ILMs have been deprecated.  Use ISMs, or USI-Core Kontainers.
- The MKS Workspace part has been deprecated, as the workspace mechanic is no longer used.
Two new modules are available in Duna, Tundra-250, and Tundra-375 form factors.
- The Colony Module represents permanent colony accomodations.  It consumes ColonySupplies, and in return, increases both habitation timers for your Kerbals.  
= The Medical Bay works only on Tourists, and at a hefty ColonySupplies cost, also increases their habitation timers.  Note that the tourists must be inside of the part.
Ranger Part Updates (Small inflatables)
- All expandable modules will have a significantly lower launch mass, but this mass will have to be repaid when they are assembled on-site.  This cost is paid in MaterialKits, and is visible in the VAB.
- Expandable modules are comparable in stats, mass, etc. to their rigid cousins once fully assembled on site.  
- The ball hub now has top and bottom nodes, and the anchor hub now has a secondary bottom node.
- Both the ball and anchor hub have had their nodes slightly adjusted.
- Added an adapter suitable for connecting VTOL-style Ranger bases onto a 2.5 stack (without losing the rear node of your anchor hub).
- The Agriculture Module is no longer a recycler.  It operates with a single agriculture bay, which can be configured for Agroponics (Mulch+Fertilizer=Supplies), or Cultivation (Substrate or Dirt + Water).  Note that cultivation with dirt is significantly less efficient.  The bay can also be configured to operate as an efficiency part for larger Duna/Tundra modules.
- Agriculture Modules will require a Kerbal with the science effect to be present in the vessel for peak operation (based on star level).
- Agriculture Modules act as a [Greenhouse] efficiency part if this converter is active and online.
- The HabModule can operate as either a hab extender (as private quarters) or as a hab multiplier (common space).  No specialties are required, and the hab module does not behave as an efficiency part.
- The crusher is limited to either mineral or gypsum based fertilizer conversions, and operates best with an engineer.
- The smelter is limited to metal/mineral/polymer based conversions, and operates best with an engineer.
- The sifter has had it's minumum abundance reduced from 2.5% to 1%
- All sifters will operate at rates more in line with other harvesters.
- The ISM no longer stores nuclear fuels, but can now store advanced supply and manufacturing resources.
- The Comm-Lab now has a 5M relay antenna built in and has experiment transfer capabilities.
- The recipe for materialkits has changed slightly to consule less chemicals.
- The recipe for Machinery has changed to be based on MaterialKits and SpecializedParts.
Duna Part Updates (The traditional MKS surface module based on the Mars DRM 2.0)
- The Duna parts got a little plump and are back to being symmetrical.
- All Duna parts are power couplers.
- On the whole, Duna modules are a lot lighter than prior versions.  They are also lighter than the Tundra or Ranger parts for similar functions.  
- The role of the Duna part is high tech in a small package.  They will be more capable than a Ranger module, but about half the size of a comparable Tundra 2.5m module.
- The Duna decals got an overhaul, and are simpler and more monochromatic.  The last red stripe on the Duna module is also gone.
- A new Duna part, the Logistics Center, has been added.  This part (or it's Tundra form-factor counterpart) is required for Planetary Logistics.
- The Duna Agriculture Model has two new modes of operation (Agriculture).)
Tundra-250 Parts (These replace the OKS parts and are based on a 2.5 cylinder).  These parts are also suitable as horizontal surface components
- The MultiTruss - a replacement for the rigid tube, with flush, doughnut, and 1.25m conical attachment modes.
- The MiniTruss - a shorter version of a MultiTruss :)
- Since a lot of the Tundra parts have dynamic adapters between different node sizes, a 'Node Helper' stick is included to block off nodes in case the wrong one is being selected when attempting to stack modules.
- The Multi-Hub, a four way hub with nodes at three levels - Ranger, 250, and 375.  Best for leveling ground bases.
- The 250 Hub, a six-way hub optimized for linking 2.5m parts.  Good for ground bases or orbital stations.
- 250 and 375 end caps for joining your 2.5m stack parts to 1.25/3.75 parts.
- A 2.5m airlock similar to the ISS Quest airlock.  Suitable for ground use (just add a ladder!) or orbital use, can hold four Kerbals.
- A smaller 1.25m airlock, can hold one Kerbal.
- Tundra versions of the Kerbitat, Agriculture Module, and PDU - all in a larger form factor than their Duna counterparts, and with larger capacities.
- The Tundra 250 Kerbitat can also be configured as living space (for those wanting a more consistent look)
- A Tundra-based Pioneer Module for your stations or surface bases, that integrates the functions of the Duna Pioneer Module and the Duna Logistics Center into a single (larger) part.
Tundra-375 Parts (These replace the octagonal Mk-III Modules)
- Larger versions of the Tundra 250 Kerbitat and Agriculture Module.  Agriculture can be configured with two separate bays.

- The Agriculture Support Module is a three-bay manufacturing part that allows all of the same functions as the Ranger crusher, but also adds water extraction from Hydrates, Ore, and Karbonite.
- The Industrial Refinery can handle all of the same resources as the Ranger smelter, but can also refine silicates, and convert ExtoticMinerals and RareMetals into RefinedExotics.
- The Industrial Regolith Sifter is much larger than the Ranger version, and can also extract even the smallest trace of resources from dirt.
- A large recycler that can convert recyclers to component resources, though this is now lossy
- An assembly plant - this handles the same conversions as the workshop, but adds ColonySupplies (formed from MaterialKits, SpecializedParts, and Organics) as well as SpecializedParts (formed from Silicon and RefinedExotics).
- A Nuclear Fuel Processor, with two bays and facilites for converting either Uraninite or DepletedFuel to EnrichedUranium
Tundra Expandable modules (like the Ranger series, these cost MaterialKits to expand)
- Three sizes - 2.75m, 4.25m, and the 19.5m ring.

-------------------
Reset default life support options to 'grouchiness'

0.33.2 - 2016.02.02
-------------------
Fixed an issue where warehouses were a bit greedy, resulting in ILMs pulling too many resources

Added an OKS version of the inflatable workshop (texture decal is temporary)

0.33.0 - 2016.02.01
-------------------
Planetary Logistics is now available.  This allows shared storage and retrieval of resources via the large MKS ILMs.  This is surface only.
Kolonization Rewards are now available.  Active MKS colonies will now automatically provide funds, rep, and science based on the corresponding number of engineers, pilots, and scientists in your base and in MKS-enabled modules.
Koloniation Bonuses are now available.  Visible via the new Kolonization icon, the longer your crew are on a planet (or in orbit, but at a reduced point), the further along kolonization will proceed.

All Duna-class and Mark III modules are automatically power couplers (less parts!)
Fixed a typo in the landing stabilizer's name
Optimized the Duna-class model for some slight perf increases
Added a probe core with EC usage to the anchor hub
Reduced hab wear rate by 90%


0.32.2 - 2016.01.20
-------------------
Updated TAC-LS configs to swap out USI-LS recyclers and fix an issue with the OKS Ag Module (Thanks jd284!)
Fixed issue where negative supply values were not displaying.
Wear and tear is disabled by default unless a mod opts to have it on.  The multiplier for this is also now included in the bundled configs.
Corrected a typo on the Sunflower lighting kit
Made OKS Ag Module resources visible in the VAB
Removed extra texture that was causing some issues with the liquid tanks (round, cylinder, and saddle)
Made salvaging have the same SpecializedParts ratio as those required by Extraplanetary Launchpads for ship construction
Fixed issues with the EL config that resulted in RocketParts still being required.  
the refinery no longer produces RareMetals and ExoticMinerals as byproducts, these can now be directly mined.
A new module, the Industrial Regolith Sifter, has been added.  This module can take Dirt and extract small quantities of all resources found on a planet.  It can also creat Fertilizer from Gypsum, and Water from Hydrates.  
A new drill capable of extracting Hydrates, Gypsum, and Dirt has been added.
The Kerbitat's Life Support recycler has been replaced with a Water Purifier.  When provided with water, it acts as a 90% Life Support recycler for USI-LS, making it the best one available.
The PDU no longer has the breeder and centrifuge functions
The larger ILMs now act as warehouses for Planetary Logistics.
The smaller ISMs now act as Distribution Warehouses.
Crew no longer need to be present inside of an MKS or OKS ag module for it to function at top efficiency.  Their efficiency caps have also been removed.

0.32.1 - 2016.01.19
--------------------
Updated archive to include missing files

0.32.0.0 - 2016.01.18
---------------------
Added USI-LS habitation support to relevant modules. 
Added several new components to aid in base setup:

- A small caster wheel to aid in moving modules 
Updated various shared components
Fixed several cost discrepancies (thanks fat-lobyte!)
Added a small starter reactor to the MKS PDU
Removed the MKS and OKS legacy PDUs
There has been a major cleanup of the logistics logic.  Older mechanics have been consolidated or replaced with Scavanging, Power Distribution, Resource Distribution, and Distributed Warehouses.  See the forum thread for details.
All logistics logic has been moved over to USITools so it can be shared with some of the other non-core mods.
Default logistics times are 5 seconds for resources and power, and 10 seconds for warehouse distribution
MKS-Lite will not be shown if UKS is installed.
The shared Kolonization DLL and associated configs has been moved to make sharing it easier.
UKS now installs in a 'UKS' folder - separate from Kolonization.  This will make sharing the core colony stuff a bit easier.
Efficiency now updates when you move crew - no need to restart converters.
Deprecated Tweakscale support
Cleaned up a few assets
The PDU and Fuel Refinery now allow their EnrichedUranium to be transferred out during maintenance, and will try to pull in DepletedFuel for their fuel recyclers.
The saddle tank has had it's mass reduced from 0.4 to 0.15 tons
When Extraplanetary Launchpads is present, RocketParts are replaced by a combination of SpecializedParts and MaterialKits in the resource chain.
When USI-LS is used, recyclers and habitation rules are in effect.  Supply consumption is also drastically increased.  Penalties for EVA loss and starvation have also been increased.  You can alter these by changing USI-LS.cfg in the Kolonization folder.
Inflatables now set to no crew capacity when deflated.  You cannot deflate a module that contains Kerbals.
Module/Mobile bases have had their KIS storage reduced to 2500.  No more bags of holding.
Inflatables have had their KIS volume trimmed from 1250 to 1000 to make using KIS storage boxes easier
Hab modules, Ag modules, and the Scout lander pod act as basic life support recyclers.
Aeroponic and Kerbitat modules act as advanced life support recyclers.
The Pioneer module comes with a colony-grade life support recycler.
Note that all life support recyclers have cumulative effects - it's always good to add more, and there is no penalty for mixing types.
Habs can be repaired via the perform maintenance option.  This requires MaterialKits.
Organics have been deprecated.  All converters now go straight to supplies.
The Kerbitat now serves as the best Habitation Multiplier for USI_LS, and a mid-range recycler.  
The Pioneer Module now serves as the best life support recycler, and also acts as a resource distributor for resource logistics (if a pilot is on board).
The Aeroponics Module has been trimmed down to a single module (cultivation), allowing for the conversion of substrate, water, and fertilizer directly into supplies.  It also includes some habitat bonuses (plants are good!) and a mid-range life support recycler.
The MKS and OKS Agriculture Modules now only have the Agroponics Module (Mulch+Fertilizer=Supplies).  Organics are depredated.  Also includes a basic life support recycler, and still works as efficiency parts for the aeroponics modules.
The MKS and OKS Hab Module/Hab Ring no longer has a converter, but instead works to extend the habitation capacity of your base.
A rudimentary TAC-LS config is included.  This config is probably wrong.  Hopefully someone with more TAC-LS experience can send a pull request :)
Inflatable Ag Modules now have crew capacity, so you can transfer crew to work in them.  Also, for best efficiency in agriculture modules, use a Scientist not an Engineer (though Engineers are a decent second choice).
Fixed the top node of the Duna class colony modules
De-bundled all of the core dependencies - these are now bundled with the Kolonization parent mod.  This should make MKS-specific updates a lot easier to download.

----------------------
From jberkman:
- Moved 6 way anchor hub to correct CTT node

Added a handy KIS 'saddle bag' to Kontainers, hods 500L
Converted Kontainer images to DDS
Added alternate nodes to the rigid tube to better connect with ball hubs, etc.
Added a new anchor hub - this small hub is KIS storable, can be anchored to the ground, and works very well if you want to make a base with 100% KIS components (this would be your root part)
Adjusted the regolith sifter - the resource threshold has been removed at the expense of efficiency, making this a much more viable first harvesting part.
Adjusted several colliders to add a bit more leeway for ground contact
Added 6-way station hub (thanks Enceos!)



0.31.9 - 2015.09.21
-------------------

From mhoram:
- Fix small issues with rover logistics
- Add ModuleFieldRepair to nukes to enable Maintenance

And other fixes!
- Corected hatches and colliders on MKS Module
- Fixed ModuleBase feet
- Fixed missing light animations for inflatable parts
- Added light emmissive to docking port
- Changed demo block's context menus to avoid confusion
- Added box collider to the bubble hub
- Reduced drill mass to be inline with stock
- The Akademy is now a lot heavier - 6.5 tons - since most modules get their weight from added machinery.
- Separated senders and receivers for power generation.  A PowerDistributor can distribute power via a PowerCoupler.  Both have separate ranges and can be on the same part.
- The Power pack is a short range PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler.  So it can power up devices within 500m.
- The (new) PDU also has both PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler capabilities, but has a very long distribution range (15km).  PDUs should be the 'Hub' in a hub and spoke base design.  It als takes on the centrifuge and breeder functions of the fuel refinery.
- THE MKS AND OKS PDU MODULES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LEGACY AND WILL BE DEPRECATED WITH KSP 1.1
- Separated logistics from MKS efficiency, so you can now easily have parts that are not MKS modules subscribe to rover logistics and power distribution.  This module is added to all MKS modules and stock drills.

0.31.7 - 2015.09.17

- The Logistics Rover now has emissive effects
- The original Mk-II Aeroponics, Kerbitat, and Pioneer modules have been replaced by the slick new 'Duna' series modules (I'll be deprecating the Mk-x designations over time because they are a bit confusing).  This newer module is meant to stack in-line with the Karibou, or be used *without* a module base.  The radial nodes are dual-sized, one for connecting to other parts, and an inset node for accepting Mk-V modules.  The Duna series modules can be put in a 3.75m fairing either horizontally or vertically!  This module also has dual flag transforms, and the floodlights (four light sources) have been replaced with a single light source to help reduce lag.
- The Bahamuto style drills have been replaced with reskinned stock drills.  NOTE!!! THIS WILL CAUSE SHIPS WITH THE OLD DRILLS TO LEAP INTO THE AIR!!! DETACH OLD DRILLS OR HILARITY MAY ENSUE!
- All of the MK-V inflatables now light up!
- Modified the Module and Mobile base parts to be compatible with the Duna series modules.
