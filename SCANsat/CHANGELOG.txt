Version 6.0 - 2014-05-17 (frozen by tg)
------------------------

* Update for KSP version 0.23.5. This version of SCANsat now requires KSP 0.23.5.

Major Changes:

+ [NEW] Big Map Caching. When not scanning, rendering of the Big Map is much, much faster. [Thanks! DMagic!]

* [KNOWN ISSUE] Sometimes the cache is not properly updated, resulting in strange looking Big Maps.
				Use the map resize button ( [\\], right hand size), resize the map a bit.
				This will reset the cache, and fix whatever is wrong.

+ [NEW] [OPTIONAL] Toolbar support. Strongly suggested, because the experience
	is better and more consistent with the Toolbar. [thanks DMagic!]

- [REMOVED] Removed the old expanding/contracting floating SCANsat button. Replaced instead with
	either a Toolbar toolbar or with nothing, but maps become visible upon starting a scan. [Thanks Dmagic!]

+ [DOCS] New README docuemntation is in Markdown format, see: https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat [tg]

+ [DOCS] New documentation in the form of imgur albums, see: https://scansat.imgur.com/ [tg]

+ [INFO] Future releases can be found here: https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat/releases/latest [tg]

+ [INFO] Source code can be found here: https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat [tg]

Minor Changes:

+ [NEW] Added support for showing the vessel icons for Asteroids in orbit around the same
			mainBody. [tg]

+ [NEW] Include SCANsatRPM by default in packaging. [tg]

+ [NEW] S.C.A.N. logo [thanks K3 | Chris!]

- [REMOVED] Non-animated parts no longer show an 'Extend' option in EDITOR. [DMagic]

+ [COMPATABILITY] "Change access modifiers to allow for more control from RPM". [thanks Dmagic!]

+ [BUGFIX] The Multispectral scanner should now be easier to highlight and click. [tg]

+ [BUGFIX] Scanning high inclinations with wide-enough FOV scanners
	(ie, Multi, RADAR, but not SAR) will no longer reveal the opposite polar region. [thanks DMagic!]
	[example orbit]:  Minmus 250.000x250.000km @ 91.0 degrees


Internal (Developer) Changes:

The following changes are only important for SCANsat or other module developers:

+ [dev] version number hardcoded, now "1.0.6.0" until version 6.1 ("1.0.6.1") or 7.0 ("1.0.7.0"). [tg]
+ [dev] Support for changing what you define as 'sea level'. Compiled to be default (ie, 0). [tg]
- [dev] Removed all unused declerations [tg]
+ [dev] Abstracted some lat/long functions to lambdas. [tg]
+ [dev]	switched to Windows line endings. [tg]
- [dev] removed windows commands in .csproj and .sln. [tg]
+ [dev] added unix commands. [tg]
+ [dev] added debugging and profiling support. Includes dummy executable. [tg]
+ [dev] [requires] that the SCANsat.dll be put directly in place (ie, GameData\SCANsat\.)
			for debugging to work [tg]


Build 5 - 2013-12-18
--------------------

- Update for KSP version 0.23. This version of SCANsat now requires KSP 0.23.

- Fixes for minor incompatibilities with Unity 4.2.2.

- Fixes for science changes in 0.23. Unfortunately, it's still necessary
  to analyze multiple times to get the full amount of science.

- Removed the deprecated slope scanner part from the distribution. This breaks
  savefile compatibility for savefiles that still use this part. If this is
  an issue, simply keep the "Scanner 4" directory from the existing SCANsat
  installation.

- Replaced models for altimetry and biome sensors with much better ones made 
  by Milkshakefiend. Original forum thread: 
  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49233-WIP-Parts-from-my-garden-shed-SCANsat-Antennae

  Note: This breaks savegame compatibility in the sense that affected parts
  look different and may be attached badly. If this is an issue, simply don't
  overwrite the existing parts when updating, or copy them back after the
  update.

- Parts with animations can be extended and retracted in the editor.
  This doesn't affect their state at launch.
   
- The big map should not open outside the screen anymore. (SirJodelstein)

- Added a button to reset window positions to settings panel. (Lalwcat)

- Fixed a bug that could sometimes prevent power consumption from being 
  turned off during high time warp.

- Biome maps now use the proper API function to determine the biome at a 
  given location, which has been fixed in 0.23 to not spam debug output
  anymore.

- Action names are configurable in the part config file. Included parts
  have been updated. (OrtwinS)

- The instruments window got its own close button. (DMagic)



Build 4 - 2013-11-10
--------------------

- Ground track should not fail anymore on certain escape trajectories.

- The SAR sensor has been replaced with a multispectral sensor, and the
  high resolution altimetry sensor has been replaced with a SAR sensor.
  (Naming change that doesn't affect gameplay.)

- All sensors had their minimum, maximum, and optimal altitudes as well
  as their fields of view adjusted slightly. These parameters are now
  configurable in the part.cfg files.
  
- A sensor's field of view degrades linearly below the optimal altitude, 
  and remains constant between optimal and maximum altitude. Parameters
  are scaled based on planet radius and SoI size, so you can still map
  Gilly.
  
- The sensor changes affect the save format. Existing saves should still
  work, but sensors will use a default set of parameters until the vessels
  they're on become active for the first time after the update.
 
- To balance the now greater need to set up a reasonable orbit for mapping,
  the temporal resolution of the scanning process is now adaptive and 
  will increase during time warp to reduce spottiness of the resulting
  tracks.

- Turning off sensors no longer closes the SCANsat UI, but the small map
  and vessel list as well as map overlays are only displayed when some 
  device on board can provide that information.
  
- If you run out of power, the minimap shows static and a lot less
  information is displayed in most windows. (OrtwinS)

- Flags on the big map have their own toggle button now. (Thourion)

- The minimap shows the area covered by the active sensors on your current
  vessel as a percentage.
 
- The "Forget Map" button has been relocated to a new settings window.
  A new button "Reset all data" is also available that resets all data
  for all celestials.
 
- The anomaly marker and the close widget character are now configurable
  in the new settings window. (drtedastro)

- Scanning can be restricted to the SoI your current vessel is in with the
  "Scan all active celestials" option in the new settings window. 
  
- Scanning can also be disabled for individual celestials. For your
  convenience, completion is shown as a percentage for each celestial.
  (Includes Altimetry, Biome, and Anomaly scans.)
  
- The temporal resolution of scanning while time warp is active can be
  configured in the new settings window. Higher resolution means more
  locations along a satellite's orbit are sampled. 
  
- Some sensors had experimental instrument readouts added that can be
  enabled via a button. Vessels equipped with a MapTraq device can also
  access some of this information if it has previously been recorded.
  The BTDT's instrument display reacts to the scroll wheel, although 
  that's only really relevant at the KSC...

- If a part has an animation set via the animationName property, the
  plugin will attempt to play it for activation and deactivation of the
  part. 

- Dragging the minimized main window doesn't maximize it anymore. (Thourion)

- If the main window is minimized or maximized close to the edge of the 
  screen, it will try to stay at that edge. (Thourion)

- A colour legend is available for height maps. (OrtwinS)

- Parts have been moved around in the tech tree a bit.

- Science data can now be collected from parts for applicable fields, based
  on how much terrain of the planet the vessel is currently in orbit around 
  has been covered. This science data must be transmitted using a suitable
  communications device like other science experiments; however, recovery is
  not possible at this time. (OrtinS, Draft, BananaDealer)



Build 3 - 2013-11-02
--------------------

- Map overlays are rendered in a more efficient way. (DMagic, OrtwinS)

- The polar orthographic projection doesn't choke on the antimeridian 
  anymore. (DMagic)

- Greyscale mode changes more colors to barrier free colors.

- The big map is now resizable and its size and position are saved in the 
  persistance file.

- Map markers now use the stock KSP icons, if applicable. (Sochin)

- More text has black outlines now to make it more readable.

- Map markers and the ground track are now visible in the zoom box. (Ortwins)

- Polar projection now displays handy S and N markers. (Thourion, OrtwinS)

- All parts now consume electrical charge. The amounts are not finalized yet
  but can be configured in the part.cfg files.

- Slope detection has been folded into altimetry. (OrtwinS)

- Existing slope sensors have become broken, and a small explosive charge has
  been activated remotely for your convenience. You can trigger it via the
  right-click menu to get rid of the part on existing vessels.

- If there are maneuver nodes on the active orbit during the time span for 
  which the ground track is rendered, the first maneuver node's position will
  be indicated on the ground track along with the ground track for one period
  of the resulting orbit.

- The GUI style should not flip between Unity and KSP style. (BananaDealer)

- Rendered maps are not exported automatically anymore. Instead, there's a
  button in the big map window that exports the current map without any of
  the overlays. Exported images are still saved in the same location. (MOARdV)

- Flags are now visible on the map.

- Double clicking a ship name in the small window now switches to that ship.

- The vessel list in the small window can now be toggled, and the window can
  be minimized to an icon only. (OrtwinS)
  
  

Build 2 - 2013-10-31
--------------------

- BTDT scanner now correctly works when the vessel is below 2000m above ground,
  instead of when the anomaly is below 2000m above sea level. (DMagic)

- Main UI now correctly shows the altitude of the vessel above ground, instead 
  of the terrain elevation above sea level below the vessel.
  
- Big map mouseover text now displays latitude and longitude in the correct 
  order. (DMagic)
  
- Geographical coordinates are now displayed in DMS. (Sochin, GhostChaser)

- Left-clicking inside the zoom box now zooms back out. (OrtwinS)

- Big map now shows a projection of the active vessel's current orbit from one
  orbital period in the past to one orbital period in the future. (Sochin)
  
- Big map now shows predicted equatorial crossings for the next few dozen orbits.

- Big map can now be rendered using the Kavrayskiy VII projection. (OrtwinS)

- Big map can now be rendered using a Polar Orthographic projection. (OrtwinS)

- A red scanning line indicates big map rendering progress. (Thourion)

- When using greyscale, text labels are displayed in cyan and orange. (sharpspoonful)

- Text labels on maps now have a black outline. (OrtwinS)

- The UI doesn't go AWOL anymore if you switch vessels in map view. (Tutman, DMagic)

- The small map doesn't paint elevations <-1500m red in greyscale mode anymore.

- Areas not covered by all active sensors on your active vessel now appear
  darker on the small map. 

- There's a switchable dot line grid on the big map. (OrtwinS)

- Map markers can be toggled in big map. (DMagic, OrtwinS)

- The zoom box acquired a close button. (Ralathon, DMagic, OrtwinS)
